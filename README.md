Running PageRank:

python3 pageRank.py filename d useEdgeWeights

Where d is a float between 0 and 1, and useEdgeWeights is either a 0 or a 1. 

This implementation of PageRank assumes a directed graph, so edges are only read in one way. If an undirected graph is the intention, the edges should be doubled in reverse in the input file.
